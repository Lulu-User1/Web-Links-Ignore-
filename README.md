### This Might Be A random Post But Let Me Explain:
 what happen is that when you click on it insted of it sending you to discord i chose what link it send sends to
 I picked a proxy browser one becuase theres a exploit on chromebook that they only accept urls that are like
 that so theres no other way i found so im just doing it like this so just ignore the post if you dont get it.
